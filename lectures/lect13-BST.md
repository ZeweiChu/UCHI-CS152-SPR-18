A binary search tree is a node based binary tree data structure. Each node contains two pointers pointing to other nodes, one to the left child node, the other to the right child node. 
- The left subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys less than (or equal to) the current node. 
- The right subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys greater than (or equal to) the current node.
